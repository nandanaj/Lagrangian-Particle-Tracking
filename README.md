#This is a project I did for my CFD course during my MS. 
It solves the 2-D Transient Navier-Stokes Equation for a jet flow, along with Lagrangian Particle tracking. One-Way coupling has been assumed between th fluid and the particles. The file "Transient Navier-Stokes Equation with Particle Tracking is the main file, with the others being fucntions. 
Second Order Central Difference Scheme was used for the spatial discretization. The temporal discretization for the Navier-Stokes Equation was achieved using the semi-implicit Fractional-Step method. The nonlinear convective terms are explicitly time-marched using Adams-Bashforth scheme and the viscous terms are solved implicitly using Crank-Nicholson scheme.The LHS_U.m and LHS_V.m achieve the spatial discretization for viscous terms, which are later solved in the TDMA.m file
As a linear tridiogonal system of equations is created for the viscous implicit terms, it can be solved using the TDMA method, which is done in the TDMA.m fileTDMA.m file returns the solution of the viscous terms, which are added to the convective terms at each timestep. Finally, the pressure correction term is added to them, to find the velocity components at each timestep. The pressure correction term is obtianed by the Poisson solver, Poisson.m
After updating the Velocity fields at each timestep, the particle field is updated using the explicit Second-Order Runge Kutta scheme, along with one-way coupling, poisSolver.m
